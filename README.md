# MongoDB_queries

This repository includes a dataset with U.S. zipcodes and their location, city, state, and population. I have also included a terminal session in which I used MongoDB to display the following results:

  1. How many zip codes are there in Texas?
  2. List the five least heavily populated zipcodes (those that have the smallest populations) in Georgia excluding zip codes with a      population of zero, as these data are likely to be missing or incorrect
  3. List the zip code and population for three zip codes in the Bronx.
  4. How many zip codes are there altogether in the Continental United States (excluding Hawaii, Alaska and Puerto Rico)?
  5. How many zip codes are there altogether in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut?
  6. List all the zip codes in Massachusetts in order alphabetically by city.
  7. List the 10 heaviest populated zip codes in descending order by population in "pretty" format.
